# sunearthmoonsim
Animated realistic simulation of the rotation of the Sun with the Earth and Moon in orbit using OpenGL and some other libraries

OpenGL is special because it communicates directly with your computer's graphics processing unit. Read more about it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL and check out https://learnopengl.com/ to start programming with it.

Sample of simulation being ran. 1 second realtime = 1 hour in simulation
